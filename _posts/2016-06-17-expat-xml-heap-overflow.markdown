## TL;DR: I found a XML bug that can fit into a Tweet!

Around one month ago I found a nice bug in the `expat` XML parser, which is very popular, it's for sure used in `Android` and `Google Chrome`, but also accordingly to [Wikipedia][expat-wikipedia] it's used also in Apache HTTP Server, Mozilla, Perl, Python and PHP. So it affects lot of software projects and lot of users.

I reported it to the Android team for disclosure but...

...today they notified me there was a bug collision, so I'm writing a blogpost to disclose it.

The coolest thing about this bug is that it can actually the trigger can fit into a tweet :D

If you make it printable it's more or less:

`<?x0?><!DOCTYPE c0 SYSTEM ""[<!----><!ENTITY R0 ""0`

Anyway let's get back to business...

## ASAN Crash

Here you can see the crash (outline is just a tool that takes from stdin the xml and output some informations using the expat library:

#### Take aways:
- AddressSanitizer will greatly improve your fault detection capabilities while fuzzing
- Grammar and corpus are very important for fuzzing
- If done right you can find bugs by fuzzing even with a single cheap machine, against the fuzzing giants like Google.
