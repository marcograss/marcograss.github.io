Some time ago I reported a bug to `Apple` found by fuzzing PDFs.

The bug resides inside the `CoreGraphics` code, and it's related to JPEGs.

You can find the reproducer PDF [here](/assets/cve-2016-4673.pdf). To trigger it you need to code yourself some code that interacts with `CoreGraphics`.

[Apple Advisory][fix-advisory]:

CoreGraphics
Available for: iPhone 5 and later, iPad 4th generation and later, iPod touch 6th generation and later
Impact: Viewing a maliciously crafted JPEG file may lead to arbitrary code execution
Description: A memory corruption issue was addressed through improved memory handling.
